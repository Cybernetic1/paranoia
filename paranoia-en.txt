Paranoia

I have persecution paranoia, or more specifically “Truman Show syndrome”.
In that 1998 movie of the same title, a guy lives in a reality show, surrounded by
actors who deceived him since childhood, but he escaped from the show finally.
In the US this syndrome has spread like an epidemic after the movie’s release.
I first visited America when I was 25 (in 1996), at the time I was infatuated with
my American cousin but rejected by her. Adding to that I had very few friends
in the foreign country, and I have a long-time aversion to white people and their
racism, I felt I was living in a hostile environment. These factors made me grew
paranoid within a year of arriving in the US. (At first it began with some suspicion
of people peeping into my e-mails....)
Today, 26 years later, I have still not “recovered”. Now that I am typing this
1

manuscript, half of my brain thinks I am typing alone in my room, another half
thinks I am typing in a Truman Show with the whole world watching.
You probably think I’m crazy. How could I believe something so absurd as The
Truman Show ?
I am a researcher in AI (artificial intelligence), a disruptive technology that may
some day in the near future turn the world order upside-down. For example,
the main difference between white people and colored people is probably just
the superficial looks, but looks are genetically inherited by DNA, and we Chinese
people cannot have those genes unless we kidnap their women for breeding. With
the advent of AI, technological progress can enable people to live forever, humans
would be freed from the dictates of genetics, and we could morph into whatever
looks we want. White supremacy would also vanish.
So, white people may not want Asians to have this technology. And indeed I
have actually experienced some hostility from American AI researchers: they’re
called OpenCog, the founder is Ben Goertzel. He is now quite famous, you can
look him up. I have tried to join them several times, but their attitude is rather
unfriendly and unwelcoming.
So, if I feel that someone from the US or the West are plotting against me, that
probability really may not be zero. Have you not heard of many anti-US political
figures killed by the US? And my political stance is strongly anti-racist, which

2

logically would entail anti-Americanism.
I’d wanted to find a ghost writer to write this book, but slowly I finished writing
pretty much all I want to say.
I was locked up in a mental hospital for 3 weeks, got to know the patients and
saw a lot of happenings, that made me sympathize with them. I was scared
shitless, pretended that I was normal so they would release me, which they did
eventually, on Christmas day. That made me think of the 1974 movie One Flew
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, in which the good guy was electrocuted into an idiot,
but the insane guy who thought he is Jesus succeeded to escape. In that movie
they also taught how to hide drug pills under the tongue; little did I know that
the trick could be so useful later.
As to psychiatric drugs, they are pretty useless, acting only to block the signals
that neurons communicate; They cause patients to be sleepy, tired, lacking motivation and sex drive, ...etc. Some boys may become feminine / grow breasts. To
put it simply, the drugs perform chemical lobotomy on your brain (even though it
may not be permanent). I know this because I have researched on how to upload
the brain’s consciousness to the computer (“mind uploading”), so I studied a
lot of neuroscience. Trust me!
John Yan is my real name — why didn’t I use a nickname? That is because I
halfly believe that you all know this already

Colonialism

My daddy used to be a Hong Kong Royal Police. After the British handover of
Hong Kong to China, he continued for a few years before retiring. When I was
young I never thought much about my daddy’s job, but I started to feel strongly
once I visited America. After all, serving under colonialism is sort of traitorous.
What is strange is that in Hong Kong many people utterly don’t feel any shame
about colonialism. Some of us even think the British government is a “stepmother”, even dearer than the birth mother. Why so? Though it is often said
that colonial Hong Kong was a place where “East meets West”, the reality is that
Westerners were still pretty segregated and unapproachable from the locals (this
situation may be changing now). Many Hong Kongers felt their legs shake when
they needed to speak English. Living under such fears, they could not recognize
the true face of colonialism.

4

When I first experienced America, I was very much in awe of their advanced
culture, just like George Bush Jr said “shock and awe”. For a while I even
stopped eating Chinese food, I wanted to eat wholly Western-style. When I
returned to Hong Kong, I saw on the newspaper a curious phrase: “western
hyprocrisy”, and that got me suddenly to start to understand the workings of
the world globally.
When I was a kid, I had a young aunt who went to England to study English
literature. I didn’t see her a lot, but I remember clearly she once told us about
her experiences when studying abroad. She said, one time when she was dining
with other students, she reached out her hand to grab a piece of bread, and a
British student said to her “Don’t touch that bread!” or something like that
(I forgot the exact words, but he wasn’t telling her to eat wholegrain bread, I
guess?) Later on she came back to Hong Kong and taught in a local Islam
school, and got leukemia and died very young. In my mind, she was a very proud
person (among the daughters of my grandma, she was probably the prettiest,
and also the highest educated), I imagined that she died in bitterness because of
the insult.

World A and world B

Ever since I got this mental illness, I cannot distinguish between World A (the
reality) or World B (the Truman Show). In the subway, when I see people gossiping, I wonder if they were talking about me. I always feel that TV shows in
Hong Kong and in the US were poking fun at me obliquely, cursing me to die
and such, and all these annoyed me greatly. But I couldn’t tell World A from
World B. In other words, I have become like a blind person, just like the story
of Samson and Delilah in the Bible 1 : After Samson was betrayed by Delilah,
they cut his hair and blinded him, and made him work futilely; He became the
laughingstock of his enemies. I often felt, this messy affair between me and my
cousin, must be the key to disentangle the whole mess, and so I keep analyzing
it endlessly. At that time my thoughts were very chaotic, it was the beginning of
the road to madness.
1

I am atheist, but I think some biblical stories are quite meaningful and can be learned from.

First thing I need to clarify is: even though I was infatuated with her, I also
despised her somewhat, and I also fancied other girls. I was just like a man
drowning in a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean, grabbing onto her like a lifesaver.
Because she is ABC (American born Chinese), she is like a ticket for me to enter
white society. It’d be so nice if I could marry her, or I’d be floating in the ocean,
struggling to get “on shore”.
Finally I got to see her in New York, but she clearly disliked me by then. At that
time I brought a book with me, an autobiography of a run-away Asian-Canadian
girl, about her prostitute street life. I knew that all girls love that kind of book,
so I left it in my aunt (cousin’s mother)’s house, and my cousin and her sister
both read it as expected. When the book came back, I was surprised to discover
a tiny piece of paper, on it was written just the words:
no escape except through death
At the time I thought it meant she wanted me to murder a high-school classmate
of mine. (Way back, my aunt brought my cousins to Hong Kong for a summer
vacation, and that was when I first started to like her. I introduced my highschool classmate to them, thinking we could have a fun time together, but my
cousin exchanged flirts with him and treated me like a fool.) The more I thought
about it, the more I felt this was an unforgivable insult, and that I must kill him
to avenge it — like a sword wedged between me and my cousin, and I had to pull
it out. But I was also in a Truman Show, how could I plot to murder someone?
7

And moreover, if my cousin really loved me, why would she require me to kill
someone as a condition? Wasn’t it because of her flirting with that guy, that
created this insult in the first place? Every time I thought of this my body shook
with anger.
More than a decade later, now I seem to understand that sentence she wrote. In
American culture, the highest-status people are blonde with blue eyes; red hair is
unlucky; and if someone has black hair, everything she touches turns into tragedy.
As for Jews, they should just straighten up their frizzy hair first. And yellow people
are still lower than Jews. I was jealous of my cousin getting “onshore” earlier
than me, as if she turned into a white person before I could. I was so jealous
I wanted to kill her, and I had never felt such a great hatred towards anyone.
Though frankly, what does this “onshore” even mean? All Chinese immigrants in
America live a second-rate, shadow-like existence without dignity. Even Whitney
Houston2 was just a shadow. Barack Obama simply chopped off his black half,
and he was so cool he even smiled at it. Note: Steve Jobs3 is exactly the kind of
person who thinks the step-mother dearer than birth-mother. In America, colored
people are getting so desperate, that even if they prostitute themselves cheaply,
white boys may not bat an eye towards them. No one could get on shore, but we
are trampling over each other to get ahead, displaying all sorts of ugliness. “No
escape except through death” may mean this.

American cousin

1991 (26 years ago), my aunt and 2 cousins came from America to visit Hong
Kong. I was 20, just entered university year 2. She was 14.
That summer our house had a lively crowd of guests. Another (boy) cousin from
England and his British friend also came to Hong Kong for vacation, and they
all stayed at our place. The night my girl cousins arrived, I just came back from
university campus, they have gone to the bedroom. My mother came out to
the living room to describe to me these strange visitors. She spoke with a very
worried look on her face, “Oh dear... your cousins look so frightening... the older
one is so fat she looks like a mountain... and the little one, she’s so young and
already putting on lipsticks, makeup and perfume like an old lady !” So I instantly
took a liking to her; These stories always begin like that.

9

We have barely known each other for one day, and she said to me, “Even cousins
can get married, if they don’t have kids.” I nodded my head deliberately and
seriously.
5 years later, the lovesick me went to New York looking for her; She said she had
a boy friend already, she had to get married and have kids; We are impossible. I
wouldn’t let go of her; I said she didn’t give me a reasonable explanation. She
said I sounded like a psychopath and scared her. Indeed, I had actually started
having paranoid thoughts (she didn’t know that); Part of the reason I wanted to
talk to her is to help me clarify whether I’m under surveillance or not, or could
she also be one among the watchers?
Actually in the summer of 1991, just days after knowing each other, she had
changed her mind, saying, “I just want an elder brother, to beat up the people
who bully me”. I remember my first response was “Huh? Beat up who?”
For 26 years I kept thinking why she rejected me.
At 14 years’ age she said: “George Bush (Senior) is fighting a war in Iraq, but he
still goes to play golf!” I said: we Hong Kong people don’t care about politics,
we don’t know what is war — and stupid things like that. Now I realize, that
what she said was very right, she was so young but she understood a lot. And
now I know the correct response should be that we should knock down American
imperialism and racism.

At the student hostel in New York, there was a big tree outside my window. In
the spring, a pair of squirrels (? I’m not even sure what animals they are) chased
each other all day long. Maybe it was their mating season, the male squirrel kept
following the tail of the female, but he always just got close to the tail, without
ever catching her, and it looked as though he’s just doing that to smell her odor;
That sight irritated me so much. I came to New York all by myself, but my cousin
didn’t want to see me, so our situation is just like that squirrel chasing the other.
This is so unbearable to watch, as disgusting as the physiological acts of shitting
and farting. I remember the title of a novel: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. I
thought of those ideal lovers in the movies, The Blue Lagoon or whatever, lovers
playing amidst a bed of flowers, the girl looks at the boy with longing eyes, that
image is so different from my reality. I am the chaser, she is chased, whereas in
The Blue Lagoon they mutually love each other. Something must be wrong, but
I couldn’t figure it out. I felt that everything is against me. Shakespeare said the
world is just a stage and we are the actors in it, but I found that my role as the
“chaser” is impossible to play successfully. I should not chase even for one step;
Just one step is wrong, but I was already chasing.
I remember another old movie: Young man got into gambling rivalry with a fat
guy, losing all his money and even his beautiful wife to the fat guy. Of course,
he won her back at the end. In the last scene, as the wife leaves him, the fat
11

guy started to cry fitfully, and she patted his back to comfort him.... Why has
this role fallen on me?
I remember another time in the subway, a mother scolded her child in front of
other passengers, and the little girl was covering her ears tight, ashamed that her
mum disclosed her bad deeds to strangers. I was like that girl, unwilling to hear
the truth.
I had an image in my mind: I was not wearing clothes, my yellow-skinned body
looked like a low animal, and I was toiling clumsily and primitively, using my
bare hands to pick up mud, to build a tiny wall trying to encircle my cousin into
my world, and that mud tower is pathetically small, it could barely circle myself,
and the inside is filthy and smelly, and my cousin was watching me from high
above and I didn’t know it. More and more I felt that this mud tower cannot
be sustained any longer, the truth is coming at me from all directions. Finally
I raised my head and saw my cousin watching me, I got angry and scolded her:
“You knew it all along that you wouldn’t love me, why didn’t you tell me earlier?”
And then suddenly I realize: Wasn’t this what she’s been telling me all the while?
and I miraculously could not take it in?
And I thought, everyone in their lives must go through the pain of heartbreaks,
why am I handling this so badly? Many of my old classmates graduated from
college, got married, had kids, and we never heard such scandals from them. Why
is everyone else adjusting so well, maybe my mum forgot to teach me something?
12

Why isn’t this in the textbooks? There’s this one friend from high school, who
climbed up his college dorm room to check on his girl friend, and saw her cheating
with another guy, and he fell from the wall and broke his leg. He’s exactly the
guy I mentioned before, the one that flirted with my cousin.
One night in the dorm room, I worked up the courage to call her on the phone,
but I was afraid. I pickup up the phone and put it down, picked it up and put
it down.... , finally I called her. She asked, “What do you want to say?” And I
said, “I... I... I...” and kept stammering the word “I”, literally for 1 or 2 minutes.
That’s because I had a guilty conscience, I did not truly love her, it’s just that I
couldn’t have her so I wanted to conquer her. I felt that my love was not real,
obviously I despised her, but I feared she could see through it. I wouldn’t die
for her, and I even predicted with certainty, that after I got her I will turn my
attention to other girls. That was like a battle of true hearts, and I felt guilty,
and I said at long last, “I.... I.... I.... love you very much.” She seemed very
offended and slammed down the phone receiver.
Later, on the internet I discussed this with an American woman, and she is a bit
arrogant, she said, “Your cousin is smart.... Forget her and move on.” But I
start to doubt it more and more. Women read a lot of romance novels, but do
they really know about love more than men do?
I recall, that she actually seemed to fancy many other boys as well. That summer
when she was 14, we were chatting randomly and the conversation landed on the
13

topic of sex. I said to her matter-of-factly, “I like many types of girls, but you,
you’re a girl and you’d only have sex with the guy you really love.” But she
said, “no, that’s not true, I sleep with everyone!” Her comeback caught me offbalance, and I was scared by the thought of her having sex with someone else. I
comforted myself by thinking she must be kidding me....
When you wait for the bus it won’t come, but when you’re not waiting you see
many. In New York when I was yearning for my cousin, lots of girls tried to seduce
me. But I deliberately ignored them, just to show how faithful I am to her. That
was just my one-sided attempt to make a reason that she must love me. One
time in a class in university, a girl sitting behind me dropped a pen, and I just
sat there with my body all tense, not picking up the pen, as I thought she was
seducing me. I even heard her “what?” uttered from her in surprise, and then
she picked up her own pen.

In New York, her male friend (not boyfriend) Ralph was acting rough with me,
warning me not to bother her. I did not fight back, not knowing what exactly
was going on. When I later complained to my aunt why my cousin would not
give me an explanation, I hit her once on the arm. Aunt called for help, and I
was beaten up by the bunch of relatives and friends that arrived. I told them
that Ralph hit me first, but I wasn’t sure if they’ve heard me or not.
14

After they beat me, I sat on the lawn outside my host’s home, my arm was
bleeding (but it was only a slight wound). Aunt was pointing at me and scolding,
“You call yourself an educated man? What kind of shit did you learn at school!?”
Later she wrote me a cheque, perhaps as some kind of break-up compensation.
After this incident I don’t see them much anymore.
That night, my aunt had come to help me move house, driving a long way to my
host’s place, but I wasn’t thankful for her and even thought she owed me. That
time was the lowest point of my life, I was literally inconsolable.
Aunt had explained some things to me before: “If she really likes you, she wouldn’t
be acting like this”, “If you think she despised you, you work harder and be better
than her.” Her words are very true indeed, and I pulled myself together and really
worked hard afterwards.
Today, 26years later, when I see Hong Kong people behaving like wusses, I feel an
urge to punch them in the face, just to teach this society to get its act together.
But isn’t that like punching the person that was me 26years ago?
I was jealous of my cousin, because her parents emigrated to America first, they
learned to be like white people, with their advanced culture and aggressiveness
and guile, whereas I was just a timid country boy from Hong Kong. I was very
mad, why was this little girl teaching me a lesson, but I couldn’t think of a single
reason to criticize her (except for some trivial things).

15

But she has her weak points too, just like any ordinary person. At 14 she said
some stupid things, so stupid you’d laugh to death. Want to hear? For example,
she said “I used not to believe in ghosts, but after watching the movie Ghost 1
I believe them now.” That lead actor Patrick Swayze had since become a real
ghost.
She also told me once, as if to give me helpful advice, “Never believe in anybody!”
Thinking back, it might be this single line of hers, added with the high-school
friend who betrayed me, that really made me not believe in anyone anymore.
The complete distrust made me unable to tell if anyone is an actor or not, even
including her.

When we first met, I often apologized to her over little things, but she said,
“Don’t say ‘sorry’ all the time, I really hate people who say sorry.” I felt dumb
and clumsy around her. After she left, I went nuts and never again apologized
to people no matter what happened. One time at the university in New York,
I was late for class, I should have said to the professor, “sorry I’m late”, but I
said instead, “I’m late.” The professor was shocked and responded with a funny
look on his face, “Mister Yan, you just said you’re late?” I nodded. I was so
dumb, that was like some kind of “silent” protest I made to my cousin — “see
1

A 1990 romantic hit movie.

16

what you’ve done to me?” Under the World A interpretation, the professor and
students would not understand this, they’d be wondering why is this Chinese guy
not saying “sorry”? And that would probably lead them to think of things like
racism and imperialism.
In New York, she scolded me for making my parents pay for the college just so
I could see her, that is so “selfish”. Later when I grew to hate her I began to
think, “What’s wrong with me coming to America to study? Does New York
belong to you?” New York belongs to whom?
On the bed in the dorm room, I was thinking of her, and the more I thought the
more I felt that I was cheated by her, but I couldn’t name the reason. Suddenly
I felt a heaviness on my chest, I pounded my chest with my fist, like a beat on
the drum, and it was only afterwards that I realized I made such a movement.
I thought immediately, “God damn, why the fuck did I act like a chimpanzee?”
That’s such a shame, the audience who were watching my reality show must have
laughed to tears.

For this matter, my parents flew to New York to help mediate. The 3 of us stayed
at aunt’s house in the basement, while aunt and the cousins lived upstairs. Once,
I was talking to my mum, she told me that my cousin showed my love letter to
her and dad, and complained of how I was harassing her. I told my mum: I
17

just wanted an explanation from her, just to talk to her (I wanted to know if
there were people watching me, as I felt at that time that my cousin was the
only person who could understand me, and I didn’t want to discuss the paranoia
with my mum, because she is among the people whom I had wanted to “expose”
(see §13)). “Why wouldn’t she even talk to me....?”

But my mum said, “We

have asked her too, but she just said she doesn’t want to see you.” I said, ‘Why
wouldn’t she talk even once with me....” and as this sentence had not finished,
my tears start rolling uncontrollably down my face, I cried like a little boy. It was
my mum who taught me to act like a macho tough man, she taught me that
boys don’t cry.
I cried, I really had not expected she could be so cruel....
I felt she betrayed me.... she would not unite with me against America.... it’d
be she uniting with America against me....
People would forget about the Iraq war.... I would be unable to tell whether
people are watching me or not.... people would think I’m crazy....
....

....

After a long time, I slowly recovered, telling myself not to believe in that Delilah
story in the Bible; I am not finished just because she betrayed me. If a woman
turned bad just replace her with another. But I have not found a good girl to
this day.

18

My younger brother also flew from England to New York to visit me, with his
Japanese school friend. I was still chiding my cousin for “not giving me an
explanation.” My brother asked me, “First of all, can you even accept the fact
that she doesn’t like you?” I said, “Of course I can accept that, I just want her
to give me an explanation.” My brother said, “You’re using your own standards
to judge others. You think it is right to give explanations for breaking up, but
some people think it is best not to say anything, you can’t force her to be like
you.” But I couldn’t listen at that time. My brother said, this trip to America
had been shadowed by my sad affair, even giving him an unpleasant impression
of New York.
I remember asking my mum, “Why didn’t she even say one word with me, don’t
you think that’s unreasonable?” Mum said, “Some women are just like that, they
like to torture and irritate men, they even feel pround of doing that!” As I recall
this, I feel that my mum is just ridiculous: How could you think my cousin is that
kind of person? Maybe you are just this kind of nasty, despicable woman?

My uncle died early, my cousin lost her father at a tender age, she is one of
those undisciplined young girls. And being American, she often laughed at our
backwardness, even my parents were afraid of her sharp words. Whereas I have
always been disciplined strictly by my parents, that made me admire her so much.
19

In Hong Kong, I brought her to drink lemonade at a place called American Café,
but she snarked that it is not a genuine American brand, and I felt losing face. To
tell the truth, why is eating at a fake American restaurant more shameful than
eating at MacDonald’s?
In The Dream of The Red Chamber 2 , (“Precious Jade”) said that men are filthy
things, but women’s essence is pure. Rumor has it that the story after Chapter 80
is not written by the original author. So the story of Precious Jade being tricked
into marrying another woman, and Black Jade dying of a broken heart, may not
be the author’s original intent. Isn’t the author

famous for the technique of

leading the reader into a trap, only to disillusion him afterwards? And that’s
why The Dream of Red Chamber is called a “dream”, isn’t it? I like using this
technique in my own writing as well! However, that plot about Precious Jade
losing his jade and meeting the True Precious Jade, is such a magical touch, that
makes me wonder if anyone could be so imaginative to complete the story?
But there’s no need to dwell on this issue, since that is just a work of fiction,
and my purpose here is not to write fiction, but to analyse and calculate with
objectivity. That is why I am critical towards everyone, including myself. We need
to rely on our own thinking to find answers, instead of believing in old books. It
is said that Fermat did not know the proof of the famous theorem that bears his
name, mathematicians generally believe that he was mistaken, and the real proof
had to wait till the development of 20-century mathematics.

As Haruki Murakami said, writing is a kind of self-therapy. If I don’t write this
down I couldn’t even tell who was right or wrong. I was once so mad that I wished
to kill my cousin, but now I just want to figure out who did wrong exactly. She
absolutely had the right to reject me, maybe the reasons were too embarassing
to admit. After all, our DNA were 12.5% identical, maybe she could not bear
to tell me, “brother, I’m officially dumping you because you look like shit, you
have no talent, and you’re much older than me” ? Even now I often ignore other
women whom I think are not pretty enough, or not smart enough.
My cousin is not really that pretty. Even while in America I have had this
reckoning: if I could not even get her, there would be no chance for me to
get those blonde-hair blue-eyed white girls. That made me feel so ashamed,
I just wanted to have 6 wives like Henry the 8th. Now I have become very
promiscuous. Who wouldn’t? To have one love only, or so-called monogamy, is
just young men and women trying to market themselves with a better price, and
then they would beg with tears saying “Sorry, but that is out of my control.”
Nevertheless, I would always feel ashamed for thinking she was not as pretty as
the white girls, remembering her face when she was angry. Now I think that
Chinese women are very pretty, maybe I am really mentally ill

Immortality

There exist clinical records of people who turned temporarily blind after suffering
traumas. Though I have not reached that stage, I went through 1∼2 years of
rage after the quarrel with cousin.
At that time, I was studying literature, and the professor said that young men
who are inexperienced with women often “put them on a pedestal”, until they
realize they have been fooled. I thought the professor knew about my affair with
cousin, and he was trying to enlighten me.

“I recall with amusement Eckert’s reaction to the impending visit. He said that he could tell whether von
Neumann was really a genius by his first question. If this was about the logical structure of the machine, he
would believe in von Neumann, otherwise not. Of course this was von Neumann’s first query.” —— Goldstine,
The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann [1972]
